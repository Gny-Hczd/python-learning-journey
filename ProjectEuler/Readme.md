# Project Euler Solutions

This folder contains my solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) implemented in Python.  
The purpose is to practice problem-solving, algorithms, and Python programming.

## Structure

- `problemXX_description.py` â€“ Python program solving problem number XX
